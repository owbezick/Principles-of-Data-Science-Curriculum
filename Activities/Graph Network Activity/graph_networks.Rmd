### Libraries Used
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(tidyverse)
library(threejs)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
```

### The Data
We have provided an .RDS file with a list outlining various cases of
dialogue by listing the speaker and the recipient of the speech.
```{r, message = FALSE}
friends_edgelist <- readRDS("edgelist.RDS") 
```

Then, let's view the first 10 rows:
```{r}
kable(friends_edgelist %>% head(10))
```

There are two main characteristics of a graph netowrk: the nodes, which are
the individual items that form the netowrk, and the edges, which signify the
connections between nodes.
