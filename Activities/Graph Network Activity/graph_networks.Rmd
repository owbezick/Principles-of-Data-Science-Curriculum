### Libraries Used
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(tidyverse)
library(threejs)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
```

### The Data
We have provided both a custom data set and an .RDS file with a list 
outlining various cases of dialogue from the tv show 'Friends', outlining instances of speech, the speaker, and the recipient of the speech. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
node_list <- tibble(id = 0:5)
edge_list <- tibble(root = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5),
                    dest = c(1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4))
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
friends_edgelist <- readRDS("edgelist.RDS") 
```

Then, let's view the first 10 rows:
```{r}
kable(friends_edgelist %>% head(10))
```

There are two main characteristics of a graph netowrk: the nodes, which are
the individual items that form the netowrk, and the edges, which signify the
connections between nodes.
